2024-02-28T16:48:11+0000,insta_post,"I have always loved music. In my studio, Miles Davis or John Coltrane are often playing in the background. The element of jazz that delights me most is the spontaneity, the way the musicians communicate with each other through their instruments, making space for one another, building an invisible and intricate web of connection.

I believe that when we choose a piece of artwork, it is because something beacons our eyes and hearts and, without thinking too much about it, we fall in love.

The beauty of improvisation, to me, is perfectly embodied by a street musician playing the music that comes to him and the passerby who is moved to spontaneous dance. This interaction captures the magic of responding to the present moment and the opportunities it offers with our hearts.

When my children were small and visiting my studio, we would sometimes crank up the volume, clear the tables to the side of the room, and dance. I continue this tradition with my grandchildren and it never fails to delight us all. My hope is that this painting brings that fun free energy into your home, and invites you to dance 🙂

Our studio originally was founded in 1992 when our father Jean-Pierre was looking for a way to both create art and support our growing family.  He discovered that he could create 3D paintings by arranging different parts of an image on multiple levels of glass. 🎨 

About 10 years ago, the studio moved to Israel, where us daughters, Davida and Safira, 🖐️ joined, bringing new ideas and helping with the day to day operations. 

As a family studio, our relationships with each other is key to the feeling and energy that go into our work. You are part of our extended studio family. Thank you for following along!

— CAFE D'ARTISTES —

It is a nighttime inspired by Vincent Van Gogh’s Cafe Terrace at Night. The couple from Renoir’s Dance At Bougival fall deeper in love as they dance. Cezanne’s players concentrate on the cards in their hands. And upstairs, a corner for Klimt’s lovers. Dark blues and greens create a backdrop that emphasizes the stillness of night as the tune of The Piano Lesson by Henri Matisse enlivens the world within Cafe d’Artistes.

We imagine that since the creation of the Café, the coffee shop has been a meeting place for the exchange and flowering of new ideas. It is a place where lovers meet and friendships grow. An invitation to a friend to have some coffee is a way of inviting them to a deeper connection. 

What better setting in which to pay homage to some of the greatest painters of the past 200 years? 

So, will we see you at the cafe? 😍

When we start our day with a sense of beauty, we are more curious, more eager to engage, more open to possibilities. 

If you live with someone you love, this is an opportunity to show them you care about the space you share. 

This piece of Audrey is particularly special. Audrey Hepburn, voted most beautiful woman in the world, had an inner grace that shone outward. 

“For beautiful eyes, look for the good in others; for beautiful lips, speak only words of kindness; and for poise, walk with the knowledge that you are never alone.” 
~ Audrey

Rachel's Tomb 

Tradition says she was buried by the road so that she could comfort her children as they were sent into exile. 
She is the motherly voice that prays for a softening when life is harsh. In her softness is her power. 

Her tomb is a holy site of prayer for Jews, Christisns and Muslims.

Up, Up & Away 
Today is your day
You are now sixteen 
So you are a queen 
You can have it your way 
And  just for today 
It's all about you!!
Then too..
Write up sixteen rules 
to use as tools 
For when you grow old 
You will always be bold 
Loved by all, but not told 
You cannot accomplish 
You're greatest wish 
To be you!

It took years to create this book!  And now, after a combined family effort, we have a beautifully illustrated and narrated story for you, read by Jean-Pierre Weill. 
(LINK TO THE FULL VIDEO in the first Comment.) 

When life feels like a battle, how can we find well being? The Well of Being, a Children's Book for Adults is our answer to that ageless question. 

May this be a year in which we bring compassion and perspective to our  struggles. May this year bring us greater clarity, connection, and emotional wellness.

Even if I'm only adding a name into the foliage of the ""Tree of Life"" or writing the title of a beloved book into the spine of one of the 📚walls in ""Bookville,"" it needs to be just right - no marks or smudges, not too hidden or to glaring. It often takes more than one try before I'm satisfied. 

But it also feels good. I know I'm making our unique artwork even more special for someone, and that they will value it the more for the personal touch. And that's important to me.
