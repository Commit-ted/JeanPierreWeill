We've been on this colorful adventure since '92, when I was searching for a way to make art and support my growing family. That's when I stumbled upon the magic of 3D paintings, and the rest is history!

About 10 years ago, we packed our brushes and moved to Israel, where my amazing daughters, Davida and Safira, hopped on board. They brought their own flair and creativity to the mix, making our studio even more vibrant.

We're not just a studio; we're a creative family, and now you're part of it too! Your love and feedback make our paints flow even smoother. So, here's to staying playful, keeping it real, and always giving our best.

This colorful and fantastical depiction of Jerusalem touches on the simple sacredness of prayer. Letters float in the air around the Heavenly Temple we build through acts of kindness.
