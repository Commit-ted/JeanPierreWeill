— CAFE D'ARTISTES —

It is a nighttime inspired by Vincent Van Gogh’s Cafe Terrace at Night. The couple from Renoir’s Dance At Bougival fall deeper in love as they dance. Cezanne’s players concentrate on the cards in their hands. And upstairs, a corner for Klimt’s lovers. Dark blues and greens create a backdrop that emphasizes the stillness of night as the tune of The Piano Lesson by Henri Matisse enlivens the world within Cafe d’Artistes.

We imagine that since the creation of the Café, the coffee shop has been a meeting place for the exchange and flowering of new ideas. It is a place where lovers meet and friendships grow. An invitation to a friend to have some coffee is a way of inviting them to a deeper connection. 

What better setting in which to pay homage to some of the greatest painters of the past 200 years? 

So, will we see you at the cafe? 😍
