Our father, Jean-Pierre, ignited our beloved studio’s journey in 1992, fueled by a profound blend of artistry and family devotion. From the inception of our mesmerizing 3D paintings to our relocation to Israel about a decade ago, every stroke of light and shadow has been a testament to our shared passion.

As his daughters, Davida and Safira, we’ve infused our vibrant palette with fresh perspectives and boundless creativity, enriching our artistic legacy.

Our bond as a family studio isn’t just the foundation of our art—it’s the heartbeat that sustains it. ✨

925734112888961,100063571427253,"Jean-Pierre Weill - 3D painting on glass","I have always loved music. In my studio, Miles Davis or John Coltrane are often playing in the background. The element of jazz that delights me most is the spontaneity, the way the musicians communicate with each other through their instruments, making space for one another, building an invisible and intricate web of connection.

I believe that when we choose a piece of artwork, it is because something beacons our eyes and hearts and, without thinking too much about it, we fall in love.

The beauty of improvisation, to me, is perfectly embodied by a street musician playing the music that comes to him and the passerby who is moved to spontaneous dance. This interaction captures the magic of responding to the present moment and the opportunities it offers with our hearts.

When my children were small and visiting my studio, we would sometimes crank up the volume, clear the tables to the side of the room, and dance. I continue this tradition with my grandchildren and it never fails to delight us all. My hope is that this painting brings that fun free energy into your home, and invites you to dance 🙂
