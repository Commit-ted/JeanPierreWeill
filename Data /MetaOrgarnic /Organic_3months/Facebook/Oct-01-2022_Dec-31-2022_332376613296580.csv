There is something about this time of year that feels fresh for new beginnings. A time to reflect on the past year and set intentions for the next one.

Art has a way of helping us see things in a new light, of giving us a fresh perspective. Take some time to create something new. 

At this time of the year, our creativity is at its peak, with all the scents, colors and textures. Does this also happen to you?

Our studio originally was founded in 1992 when our father Jean-Pierre was looking for a way to both create art and support our growing family.  He discovered that he could create 3D paintings by arranging different parts of an image on multiple levels of glass. 🎨 

About 10 years ago, the studio moved to Israel, where us daughters, Davida and Safira, 🖐️ joined, bringing new ideas and helping with the day to day operations. 

As a family studio, our relationships with each other is key to the feeling and energy that go into our work. You are part of our extended studio family. Thank you for following along!
